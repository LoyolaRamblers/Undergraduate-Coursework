There are many different variables in the comprehensive data set, including (but not limited to) grade, gender, age, handedness, height, foot length, arm span, languages spoken, travel mode and time to school, reaction time, birth month, favorite season, average hours of sleep, and household size.\n\nThere are several interesting characteristics in the data set, including that the median recorded height is ",median(data$Height_cm)," centimeters (",median(data$Height_cm)/2.54," inches). This appears to be because some heights were recorded in inches, and missing values were recorded as '1'. Also, ",nrow(data[data$ClassGrade==12,])/nrow(data)*100," percent of students sampled are seniors, which is significantly higher than the average of ",1/length(table(data$ClassGrade))*100," percent that one would initially expect. Strangely, ",nrow(data[data$Vegetarian=="Yes"&data$Favorite_Food=="Meat",])/nrow(data[data$Vegetarian=="Yes",])*100," percent of students (",nrow(data[data$Vegetarian=="Yes"&data$Favorite_Food=="Meat",])," out of ",nrow(data[data$Vegetarian=="Yes",]),") who were recorded as vegetarian were also recorded that their favorite food is 'Meat'.",sep="")

The histogram provides a visual representation sorted by proportion of missing values from greatest to least. Blue squares indicate non-missing (recorded) values and red squares indicate missing values. Although the labels on the y-axis of the plot are essentially unreadable because there are ",length(data)," variables, we can extract the data from the plot and see that ",sort(aggr(data,plot=FALSE,bars=FALSE)$percent,decreasing=TRUE)[1]," percent of observations do not contain any missing values.",sep="")

These variables all contain missing values, do not serve as direct proxies of other variables, and have, if not at least a weak correlation, some remote but relatively understandable relationship with armspan and height. The runtime for this function was approximately ten minutes.

As I mentioned earlier, a lot of the measurements appear to be recorded in inches, and some missing values are recorded as "1". The median recorded height is 56 centimeters (22 inches). We can see these effects in the histograms of both variables with the median displayed. I considered "transforming" some of the observations from inches to centimeters by multiplying by 2.54, but there was no definite "cutoff" point in the data which allowed me to distinguish a data entry mistake from a true observation, and outliers would still remain recorded as practically absurd observations (for example, there would be 29 observations recorded as 2.54 centimeters after the transformation).
